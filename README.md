# 👾 SynthCode [CYBR]

Hey, I’m **SynthCode** — a software developer fueled by **clean code, tight loops**, and late-night focus sessions powered by synthwave 🎵🌌.  

I treat development like a craft: **logic, rhythm, and iteration guide everything I build**. Most of my time is spent in the terminal 🐧💻, using tools that stay out of the way and let me think clearly. I value **function over flash, minimalism over noise**, and code that works as hard as I do ⚡.
